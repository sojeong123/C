NEAR FAR
WHEREVER YOU ARE
I BELIEVE THAT THE HEART DOES GO ON
ONCE MORE, YOU OPEN THE DOOR
AND YOU'RE HERE IN MY HEART
AND MY HEART WILL GO ON AND ON

near far
wherever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more, you open the door
and you're here in my heart
and my heart will go on and on
